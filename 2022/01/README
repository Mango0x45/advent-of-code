puzzle-1.awk and puzzle-2.awk were my original solutions.  puzzles.awk is a
solution I wrote afterwards while reading the Gawk documentation, because I
wanted to play around with setting RS to the empty string (this allows you to
have blank-line seperated records).  It also works, and works just fine, so I'll
leave it in this repo.
