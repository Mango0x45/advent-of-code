This continues from the last puzzle, so our starting string is “hepxxyzz”

Following the theme of the previous puzzle, we want to create an “xxyzz” pattern
in the lowest amount of increments possible.  Since the string currently ends in
“xxyzz”, we know that the next possible value we could have that satisfies this
property is “aabcc”.  In order to go from “xxyzz” to “aabcc” however, you need to
overflow which would increment the “p” to a “q”.  This gives an end result of
“heqaabcc”.

QED.
